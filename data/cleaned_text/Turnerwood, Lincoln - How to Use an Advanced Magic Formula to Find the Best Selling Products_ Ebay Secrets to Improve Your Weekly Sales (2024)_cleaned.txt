introduction copyright 2024 this book gives you 100 tips on how to grow and set up your ebay business. but also, and more importantly there is one magic formula that shows you how to discover all the top selling products on ebay. this formula both gives you ideas on what to sell on ebay and what products ' sell well '. let me give you one big tip to start with. don ' t try selling something you ' think ' should work. thinking and knowing are two different words. too many people do very little investigation and think they ’ ve solved the puzzle on how to sell as they base their decision that lots of other people are selling it, so it must work. no! what we must understand is you ’ re not alone and that everyone around the world uses the same principle of selling, the idea that i ' ve just explained, the ' i think i know ' principle, eventually meaning you ' re selling what everyone else is selling. you need to sell what people are buying. this is where the ' magic ' formula comes into play. i once read about the famous ' penny black stamp ' in the uk, that people will pay what they want to pay. meaning that the eventual selling price will settle according to supply and demand. so you ' d expect one of the first stamps in the uk should be worth £thousands. but that ' s not the case... they are fetching £119 +. so the process of economics finds a balance ( supply and demand ). i would also like to introduce the ' convenience factor '. a convenience store sells products slightly more expensive than a major supermarket … and of course online buying is convenient. within these two considerations we need to consider a couple of twists and turns on supplies, demands and prices when selling on ebay. but the ' key ' to being a success on ebay is to sell what people are buying. don ' t give up on your original idea, don ' t dismiss that concept … but first do the investigation with the magic formula and follow the principle of sell what is buying... and then re - introduce your original concept months or years later when hopefully you ’ ll have greater knowledge that you ' ll have acquired in the meantime. the magic formula will bring up surprises. allow me to use a metaphor, " whatever flips your switch ". in these 1, 000 ' s listings the magic formula will surprise you, you ' ll find curious and intriguing products, where you can choose whichever flips your switch. what a tool this magic formula is?! a couple more comments before i continue with the main text. i cannot express enough, that ebay works like the internet, its algorithms work using ' keywords '. this is really important. ebay themselves have suggested that the first 4 words in your ' title ' are the most important. use the brand name if it is important, otherwise use the product name … don ' t use 200 packs of 10, for example as the first 4 words, unless the product is sold that way and those then become your keywords. do start with : don ' t start with : samsung galaxy s20 fe unused in good condition seiko 5 vintage watch pre - owned automatic hand winding you have 80 characters in the ' title description ', so start with the most important 4 regardless of whether it makes good english sense. then try and use all 80 characters with the other keywords that are secondary, such as unused in good condition. keywords, keywords, keywords - for online real estate, not too dissimilar to location, location, location for property. test your headline text to see which works best. also test your ' description ' too. use keywords in your description, but don ' t over use them. sometimes a 30 word description works better than a 200 word description. test, test, test. chapter 2 - the magic formula this magic formula given below can be improved for specific products, so you ' ll need to explore with other options yourself. i suppose you can call it a science, if you improve the keywords within the line you could improve your results. i ' ll not explain how it works ( i do down below briefly ), as it should be self explanatory. once you ' ve used it you ' ll see why those words are chosen. keywords, keywords, keywords! as you progress you ' ll understand why those words have been chosen and what words can be use for your own personal gain. using parenthesis ( " " ) basically means ' specifically ' … but you can try keywords without parenthesis, as it give more options. here is the magic formula, paste this into the google search engine ( but also try other search engines too ). site : ebay. co. uk " sold " " contact seller " " have already sold " as you may have noticed with ebay, they change the format of their pages. so be aware that this magic formula will need changing to keep up with ebay ' s changes to presentation. i will give a brief explanation : site : ebay. co. uk - means search this site please ( you can put any website in here ) " sold " - means you want products that you ' ve know have the words in the sellers description as ' sold ' " contact seller " - just another keyword in the sellers description to aid pulling listing opportunities only, rather than their ' help ' website " have already sold " - a relatively new addition. normally says before this, 2, 667, 10 or 20, 000 ' have already sold '. you need this one in ( smile ) … try these two also : site : ebay. co. uk " this one ' s trending " " quantity : " " already sold " - site : ebay. co. uk " quantity : " " already sold " see this next image to discover the application of the magic formula. i have circled in red 3 examples on how indentifying the quantity are being sold. a few considerations to remember : 1 ) most of the time the quantity sold is based on when the item was last listed 2 ) so showing 33 could mean it has started 3 weeks ago 3 ) whereas if it says 6570, could mean it started 9 months ago 4 ) so... although you see a quantity you need to further research 5 ) but hey... this magic formula will save so much time if you really want to expand on this ' search request ' then i suggest you go explore google and find out other additions you can add. the possibilities are almost endless... chapter 3 -
